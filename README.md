## Mizzou K-12
I've had an account on Mizzou K-12 for a long time now and I decided to write it's initial login webpage.<br>
I don't own the rights; you can acess it by clicking <a href="https://courses.mizzouk12.missouri.edu/login/canvas">here</a>.<br>
It was just a test, so I didn't take the time to add Javasript, cookies, etc.<br><br>
**TO MIZZOU K-12 STAFF:** If you want to, <a href="https://t.me/bored_user">contact me</a> and I'll delete the repo.<br><br><br>
